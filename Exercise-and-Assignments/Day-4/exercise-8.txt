## passsing and managing variable while running a playbook.
# Overriding variables from the command line,

$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml -e "username=user10"

--------------------

## working with handlers
## in the playbook where we want to restart the webservice only under certain condition, we use handlers.

$ vi playbook.yml

## add the handlers section inside the playbook, outside the tasks section. the handler task then is called using the notify function added to the deploy site task.

handlers:

  - name: restart_webservice
    service:
        name: "{{service_name}}"
        state: restarted

## remove the "restart webservice" task from tasks section.
## add the notify function in Copy task.

tasks:

  - name: deploy site
    copy:
      src: index.html
      dest: /var/www/html/index.html
    notify:
      restart_webservice

## now, first make change to the index.html file and then try running the playbook with ansible-playbook command.

$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml -K

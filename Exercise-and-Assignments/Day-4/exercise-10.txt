## while we are running the playbook against number of host as group, we can alter the order of execution of playbook on the hosts.
## options are sorted / inventory / reverse_inventory / reverse_sorted / shuffle.


hosts: all
order: sorted
gather_facts: False
tasks:
   - name:

--------------------------
## let's implement Parallelism in implementing tasks on number of hosts.

hosts: all
serial: 2  or,
        "50%"    or,
serial: 1
        5
        10   

--------------------------
## using conditional statement

tasks:
-  name: take an action on certain conditional fulfilment
   when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "RedHat"
   command: '/usr/bin/pwd'

or,

tasks:
  - name: manage users
    user:
        name: "{{username}}"
        state: present
    when: (ansible_facts['os_family'] == "RedHat" or
           ansible_facts['distribution'] == "RedHat")
    
  - name: manage service
    service:
        name: "{{service_name}}"
        state: stopped
    when: (ansible_facts['os_family'] == "RedHat" and
           ansible_facts['distribution'] == "RedHat")

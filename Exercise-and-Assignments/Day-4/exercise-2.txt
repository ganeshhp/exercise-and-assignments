## let's start with exploring the Ansible-core code environment and other config files.

## check the ansible version using command,

$ ansible --version

# in the output look for the config file location. if the config file is not available, create one manually.

$ mkdir ansible

$ cd ansible

$ vi ansible.cfg

[defaults]

inventory = <user-home-directory>/ansible/hosts

## save and exit the file
## now run command, to view config file contents.

$ ansible-config view

## now let's create our first inventory file.

$ vi hosts

localhost

[webserver]
192.168.33.100
192.168.33.101

[dbserver]
192.168.33.101

## save and exit file
## now this is our Inventory file
## let use the command to view and understand the managed hosts in inventory.

$ ansible-inventory --list
$ ansible-inventory --graph

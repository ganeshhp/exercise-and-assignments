## let's understand the ad-hoc command.

  $ ansible -i hosts <group-or-hostname-as-per-inventory> -m setup

## let's test it on localhost

  $ ansible -i hosts localhost -m setup

## this shows we have an error connecting to localhost as ansible tries connecting to localhost using SSH.

  $ ansible -i hosts localhost -m setup -a "filter=ansible_os_family" --connection local

## Similar to Localhost we want to manage the remote host. we will have to set SSH connections between ansible server and the node.
##let's test the connection

  $ ssh <ip-address-of-node>

## if you are able to connect to the remote host over SSH using password authentication, let's run ansible command.

  $ ansible -i hosts <ip-address-of-remote-host> -m setup -k

## here -k allows ansible to prompt for SSH password.
## now try checking usage of ansible-doc command. this command gives documentation about built-in ansible modules.

  $ ansible-doc -l

  $ ansible-doc yum

## now let's try running tasks that require sudo previlages

  $ ansible-i hosts localhost -m yum -a "name=nginx use_backend=dnf state=present" --connection local --become -K

## let's understand about Tags.
## If we have large number of tasks and you want to selectively run a task or number of tasks or a play then we can make use tags to selectively execute a task or a play.

## In the playbook file, tags can be added as shown below.

tasks:
- name: install packages
  yum:
    name:
    - httpd
    - memcached
    state: present
  tags:
  - packages

- name: deploy templates
  copy:
    src: index.html
    dest: /var/wwww/html/index.html
  tags:
  - configuration

## in the above playbook tasks, to run the tasks, we have to add tag details, as shown below.

$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml --tags "configuration, packages"

## or, to eleminate any tasks with refernce to a Tag.

$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml --skip-tags "packages"

--------------------------

## Ignoring failed Command or Shell module tasks.

$ vi new-playbook.yml

tasks:
-  name: run this command and ignore the result
   shell: /usr/bin/somecommand
   ignore_errors: True


---------------------------

## Using Variable Prompt to access valiable value at run time.

$ cd ansible
$ vi userplaybook.yml

## 
---
- hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  become: true
  vars_prompt:
    - name: username
      prompt: "What is your username?"
      private: no
    - name: password
      prompt: "What is your password?"
      private: yes
  tasks:
    - name: validate the entered username value
      debug:
        msg: 'Logging in as {{ username }}'
    - name: create user with entered username value
      user: 
        name: "{{ username }}"
        password: "{{ password }}" 
        state: present

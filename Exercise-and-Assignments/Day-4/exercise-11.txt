## Now let's understand what are roles.
## inside the ansible folder, first create the roles folder and then run the ansible-galaxy command to create the role structure.
$ cd ansible
$ mkdir roles
$ cd roles
$ ansible-galaxy init webserver

## here in the command, webserver is the role name.
## now, we will breakdown the playbook.yml playbook file into the "Webserver" role. So, let's move the playbook contents from playbook.yml file into the webserver role folder structure.

## first let's move the tasks from the first play into tasks/main.yml file.

$ vi webserver/tasks/main.yml

## save and exit file.

## declare variables inside vars folder /vars/main.yml file.

$ vi webserver/vars/main.yml

## save and exit file.

## move the handlers tasks from handlers section from playbook to the handlers/main.yml file.

$ vi webserver/handlers/main.yml

## save and exit.

## move the 'index.html' file from files folder of ansible root to files folder of webserver role.
## Now, in the playbook.yml file the first play will only have the metadata about managed hosts, remote_user, gather_facts, become. And tasks declaration is to be replaced with roles declaration.

roles:
  - webserver

## Similarly, tasks declaration inside the second play is to be moved into tasks YAML file of one more role, created as 'users'. Variables, handlers if any , similar way.

roles:
   - users

## try running the playbook.yml file again same way.

$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml -K

## we expect to have similar results, but this time the playbook only has the metadata and roles are called.

## creating a playbook.
## till now we have run ad-hoc commands and also used ansible-console command. but in order to work with multiple tasks, we have to use a playbook.

$ cd ansible
$ vi playbook.yml

- name: sample playbook
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: true
  connection: local

  tasks:
     - name: first task
       setup:
          filter: 'ansible_local' 

## save and exit file.
## let's the run the playbookk using below command.

$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml

## observe the logs.

## now, let's write a playbook to test custom facts.

- name: test custom facts
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  gather_facts: true

  tasks:
     - name: test custom facts
       degub:
           msg: "the application user name is {{ ansible_local['custom']['appinfo']['appuser'] }}"

## taking this further to overcome the challenges in ad-hoc command in ansible we have command, ansible-console

  $ ansible-console -i hosts localhost --connection local --become -K

## this will open a REPL console to run tasks on the targetted hosts under the hosts inventory
## try running help on the console

  $ help

  $ yum name=nginx state=present use_backend=dnf

  $ command pwd

## Using ad-hoc command with different modules

  $ ansible -i hosts <remote-host> -m user -a "name=ganeshhp state=present" --become -K

## try using the service, file, yum modules after understanding the argument optins from ansible-doc command.
## using variables

  $ ansible -i hosts localhost -m yum -a "name={{package_name}} state=present" --become --connection local -K

## as we see the error for undefined variable. let's define the variable. this time inside the inventory file.

  $ vi hosts

    localhost package_name=nginx

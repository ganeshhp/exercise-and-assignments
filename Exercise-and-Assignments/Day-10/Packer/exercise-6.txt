### after we have build the package (image) we can add more action on the package using  
### post-processors

post-processor "docker-tag" {
  repository = "learn-packer"
  tags       = ["jammy"]
}

### Here as well we can add the only statement so that the post-processor runs only for a 
### particular build, as shown below.

post-processor "docker-tag" {
  repository = "learn-packer"
  tags       = ["jammy"]
  only       = ["docker.ubuntu"]
}

### here the docker-tag is a type of post-processor that we use for tagging the image name.
### let's add one more docker-tag post-processor for other source build.

post-processor "docker-tag" {
  repository = "learn-packer"
  tags       = ["24.04"]
  only       = ["docker.ubuntu-focal"]
}

## sequential post-processor.
### we can add one more processor that will follow the docker-tag post-processor.

post-processor "docker-import" {
    repository = "ganeshhp"
    tag =  ["ubuntu", "focal"]
    only = ["docker.ubuntu-focal"]
  }

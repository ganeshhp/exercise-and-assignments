### Parallel builds

### one configuration file can be used for multiple builds, we can check this as follows.

## add a source statement to the config file.

source "docker" "ubuntu-focal" {
  image  = "ubuntu:focal"
  commit = true
}

### now add the source in the build as follows.

build {
  name    = "learn-packer"
  sources = [
    "source.docker.ubuntu",
    "source.docker.ubuntu-focal",
  ]
}

### the source name need not be same for all sources. It can be different as well, like AWS.
     
## for the provisioner block we will add "only" statement so that the provisioning can be forced for a particular source only and not all parallel sources.

  provisioner "shell" {
    environment_vars = [
      "package_name=apache2",
    ]

    only = ["docker.ubuntu"]

    inline = [
      "apt-get update",
      "apt-get install -y $package_name",
    ]
  }

## let's understand what's terraform modules
## Modules are containers for multiple resources that are used together. A module consists of a collection of .tf and/or .tf.json files kept together in a directory.
## Every Terraform configuration has at least one module, known as its root module, which consists of the resources defined in the .tf files in the main working directory.

## clone the repository to your terraform server

$ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/learn-terraform-init

$ cd learn-terraform-init

### Data sources allow Terraform to use information defined outside of Terraform, defined by another separate Terraform configuration, or modified by functions.
### Each provider may offer data sources alongside its set of resource types.
